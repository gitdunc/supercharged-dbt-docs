# Governance Docs

This folder provides practical governance guidance for this repository, aligned to DAMA-style capability areas.

## Contents

- `data-ownership.md`
- `data-security.md`
- `data-classification.md`
- `data-glossary.md`
- `metadata-management.md`
- `data-quality-observability.md`
- `lineage-impact.md`

## Scope

- This project is a teaching-oriented governance accelerator.
- Controls in this repo are informational and process-oriented unless explicitly automated in code.
- Persona filters in the UI improve readability; they are not access-control enforcement.
